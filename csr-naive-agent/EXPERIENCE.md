## Design Principles

### 1. Empathy First
Every design decision serves a genuine user need. We start simple and evolve through feedback. The interface should make users feel understood, not lost.

### 2. Data-Informed, Not Data-Driven
Metrics inform our decisions, but creativity and human understanding drive design. Numbers tell us what's happening; design tells us why.

### 3. Start Simple, Evolve Through Feedback
The first version of any feature should be usable but minimal. We add complexity only when users need it and request it.

### 4. Consistency Across Contexts
The same patterns, colors, and interactions apply across all five contexts (Customer, Order, Shipment, Billing, User Management). This reduces cognitive load and increases learnability.

### 5. Accessibility by Default
No feature is considered complete without accessibility compliance. Contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support are built in, not bolted on.

### 6. Error Prevention Over Error Recovery
Better to prevent errors than to explain them. Clear validation, confirmation modals, and disabled unavailable options reduce the chance of mistakes.

### 7. Transparent Operations
Every action should be traceable. Audit logs, status indicators, and clear error messages build trust and enable users to understand what's happening.

### 8. Performance Matters
Page load < 3 seconds, API responses < 200ms (p95), smooth interactions at 60fps. Performance is a feature, not an afterthought.

### 8. Mobile-First, Responsive
Design works on mobile devices first, then scales up to desktop. Touch targets minimum 44px, responsive breakpoints at 48rem (768px).

### 8. Speed of Implementation
Design tokens and components are implementation-ready for the FastAPI/Streamlit stack. No speculative design that can't be built in the sprint.
