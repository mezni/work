<!-- TEMPLATE GUIDE — act on these comments, then delete them; never emit a comment in the finished spine. This is a shape, not a script: keep only the sections this spine needs and cut the rest (no empty headers). A small intent may be just paradigm + a few ADs + conventions; a platform earns more. An inherited epic spine is usually mostly Inherited Invariants + a thin Deferred. Decisions, not rationale (rationale lives in the memlog). Carry shape in diagrams; prose only where it must. -->

## Design Paradigm

**Hexagonal (Ports-and-Adapters)** — the core domain layer knows nothing of FastAPI, Streamlit, SQLite, or tool catalog implementations. Interaction happens through explicit ports (interfaces) and adapters (implementations). This enforces the domain-layer constraint from the PRD and enables the SQLite → PostgreSQL migration path without domain changes.

## Inherited Invariants

*(No parent spine inherited — this is the initial epic spine for csr-naive-agent.)*

## Invariants & Rules

### AD-1 — Hexagonal architecture with domain layer isolation

- **Binds:** FR-01 through FR-34; all NFRs in sections 6.1–6.5; domain entities and use cases
- **Prevents:** domain layer importing FastAPI, Streamlit, or tool catalog implementations; direct database coupling in domain models; framework-coupled business rules
- **Rule:** The domain layer (csr_naive_agent/domain/) must not import FastAPI, Streamlit, or any tool catalog SDK. All external interactions go through ports defined in `domain/ports/` and implemented in `application/adapters/`. The repository pattern (interface in domain, implementation in infrastructure) enables ORM switching.

### AD-2 — Scope-based authorization with explicit RBAC

- **Binds:** AuthN/AuthZ Mapping table (FR-01 to FR-34 → required scopes → role minimum); `Read`/`Write`/`Financial Write`/`User Management` scopes; RBAC roles (Viewer, Operator, Manager, Administrator, User Manager)
- **Prevents:** role ambiguity (e.g., Operator performing user management without `User Management` scope); missing scope checks at route level; implicit permission escalation
- **Rule:** Every FastAPI route must depend on `get_current_user_with_scope` checking the exact required scope per the AuthN/AuthZ Mapping table. The `User Management` scope is orthogonal to `Read`/`Write`/`Financial Write`; user CRUD operations require explicit `User Management` scope, not general `Write` scope.

### AD-3 — Repository pattern for ORM independence

- **Binds:** Scalability section (SQLite → PostgreSQL migration path); repository pattern enablement in domain layer
- **Prevents:** domain entities referencing SQLAlchemy models directly; hard-coded SQL queries in use cases; migration breakage when switching databases
- **Rule:** Domain entities use plain Python types (no SQLAlchemy imports). Repository interfaces (read/write methods) live in `domain/ports/`; concrete repositories using SQLAlchemy live in `infrastructure/repositories/`. The application layer depends on domain repositories, not on SQLAlchemy models.

### AD-4 — PCI-DSS compliant payment data handling

- **Binds:** FR-24 (payment transactions with masked account/card details); NFR 6.3 Security (payment method masking)
- **Prevents:** storage of full card numbers in any database or log; unmasked card data in API responses or error messages
- **Rule:** Card numbers must never be stored. Payment method data stored as masked format (e.g., "Visa ending in 4242") or tokenized. The `get_billing_history` tool returns only masked data. Any card data received from clients must be masked immediately at the API boundary.

### AD-5 — Audit logging scope

- **Binds:** FR-27 (issue_refund operations); user management operations (create_user, update_user, delete_user, FR-28/29/30/33); NFR 6.3 Security audit logging clause
- **Prevents:** unaudited monetary transactions; unlogged user lifecycle events; audit log gaps for compliance
- **Rule:** Every `issue_refund` request must produce an audit log entry with: timestamp, user ID, refund amount, order ID, reason. User management CRUD operations (FR-28/29/30/33) must also produce audit entries. Audit logs stored in a compliant storage (initial: SQLite; future: dedicated audit store). Log entries include user identity, operation type, timestamp, and outcome (success/failure).

### AD-6 — Password hashing requirement

- **Binds:** NFR 6.3 Security (passwords hashed using bcrypt/Argon2); authN section password policy
- **Prevents:** plain-text password storage in database; password reuse without hashing; compliance failures
- **Rule:** All user passwords must be hashed using bcrypt or Argon2 at the point of creation/update. Never stored in plain text. Password policy: minimum 8 characters, mix of upper/lowercase and digits, account lockout after 5 failed attempts (30-minute lockout). The authN layer handles verification; the domain layer never sees raw passwords.

## Consistency Conventions

| Concern | Convention |
| --- | --- |
| **Naming** (entities, files, interfaces, events) | `snake_case` for Python modules/variables; `PascalCase` for classes; `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants; FR IDs as `FR-n`; `AD-n` for architecture decisions |
| **Data & formats** (ids, dates, error shapes, envelopes) | UUIDs for domain event IDs; ISO 8601 datetimes; API errors: `{"error": "code", "message": "..."}`; pagination: `{"items": [...], "next_cursor": "..." or null}` |
| **State & cross-cutting** (mutation, errors, logging, config, auth) | Mutation only through explicit commands/use cases; errors raised as HTTPExceptions (FastAPI) or domain exceptions (domain layer); structured logging with correlation IDs; config from environment variables with sensible defaults; auth via Bearer JWT tokens validated by `get_current_user` dependency |

## Deferred

- **CQRS pattern** for read-heavy operations (customer accounts, order history, billing history) vs write operations — deferred to Phase 2 when scale warrants the complexity
- **Event sourcing for audit trails** — deferred; NFR 10.3 technical debt paydown item; can revisit when audit requirements expand beyond log files
- **GraphQL API alongside REST** — deferred to Phase 3; not needed for MVP
- **Multi-tenant support** — deferred to Phase 2; initial scope is single-tenant (one DB per organization as per assumptions)
- **Webhook notifications for shipment status changes** — deferred to Phase 2; carrier API webhook integration
- **Advanced reporting and analytics dashboard** — deferred to Phase 3; initial focus is CRUD + tracking + billing
- **Integration with external version control systems** — deferred; out of initial scope
- **Notification system (email/SMS)** — deferred to Phase 3; initial focus on core functionality
