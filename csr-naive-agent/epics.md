> The previous NFR18–NFR28 entries were exact duplicates of NFR07–NFR17 and have been removed.

### Additional Requirements (from Architecture)

AD-1: Hexagonal architecture with domain layer isolation  
- Binds: FR-01 through FR-32; all NFRs in sections 6.1–6.5; domain entities and use cases  
- Prevents: domain layer importing FastAPI, Streamlit, or tool catalog implementations; direct database coupling in domain models; framework-coupled business rules  
- Rule: The domain layer must not import FastAPI, Streamlit, or any tool catalog SDK. All external interactions go through ports defined in `domain/ports/` and implemented in `infrastructure/`. The repository pattern enables ORM switching.

AD-2: Scope-based authorization with explicit RBAC  
- Binds: AuthN/AuthZ Mapping table (FR-01 to FR-32 → required scopes → role minimum); `Read`/`Write`/`Financial Write`/`User Management` scopes; RBAC roles (Viewer, Operator, Manager, Administrator, User Manager); canonical matrix in `AUTHZ-MATRIX.md`  
- Prevents: role ambiguity (e.g., Operator performing user management without `User Management` scope); missing scope checks at route level; implicit permission escalation  
- Rule: Every FastAPI route must depend on `get_current_user_with_scope` checking the exact required scope per the AuthN/AuthZ Mapping table. The `User Management` scope is orthogonal to `Read`/`Write`/`Financial Write`; user CRUD operations require explicit `User Management` scope, not general `Write` scope.

AD-3: Repository pattern for ORM independence  
- Binds: Scalability section (SQLite → PostgreSQL migration path); repository pattern enablement in domain layer  
- Prevents: domain entities referencing SQLAlchemy models directly; hard-coded SQL queries in use cases; migration breakage when switching databases  
- Rule: Domain entities use plain Python types (no SQLAlchemy imports). Repository interfaces live in `domain/ports/`; concrete repositories using SQLAlchemy live in `infrastructure/repositories/`. The application layer depends on domain repositories, not on SQLAlchemy models.

AD-4: PCI-DSS compliant payment data handling  
- Binds: FR-24 (payment transactions with masked account/card details); NFR 6.3 Security (payment method masking)  
- Prevents: storage of full card numbers in any database or log; unmasked card data in API responses or error messages  
- Rule: Card numbers must never be stored. Payment method data stored as masked format (e.g., "Visa ending in 4242") or tokenized. The `get_billing_history` tool returns only masked data. Any card data received from clients must be masked immediately at the API boundary.

AD-5: Audit logging scope  
- Binds: FR-27 (issue_refund operations); user management operations (create_user, update_user, delete_user, FR-28/29/30/31); NFR 6.3 Security audit logging clause  
- Prevents: unaudited monetary transactions; unlogged user lifecycle events; audit log gaps for compliance  
- Rule: Every `issue_refund` request must produce an audit log entry with: timestamp, user ID, refund amount, order ID, reason. User management CRUD operations (FR-28/29/30/31) must also produce audit entries. Audit logs stored in compliant storage (initial: SQLite; future: dedicated audit store). Log entries include user identity, operation type, timestamp, and outcome (success/failure). See `DATA-MODEL.md` → AuditLog.

AD-6: Password hashing requirement  
- Binds: NFR 6.3 Security (passwords hashed using bcrypt/Argon2); authN section password policy  
- Prevents: plain-text password storage in database; password reuse without hashing; compliance failures  
- Rule: All user passwords must be hashed using bcrypt or Argon2 at the point of creation/update. Never stored in plain text. Password policy: minimum 8 characters, mix of upper/lowercase and digits, account lockout after 5 failed attempts (30-minute lockout). The authN layer handles verification; the domain layer never sees raw passwords.

**Story set canonical.** This document now contains a single canonical list of **27 stories** across 5 epics (5/7/5/5/5). The duplicate auto-generated block (which reported a bogus "289 stories") was removed. Story 4.6 was removed because it duplicated FR-25 (return eligibility), which is owned by Epic 2. FR-33/FR-34 were renumbered to FR-31/FR-32 to close the numbering gap. See `AUTHZ-MATRIX.md` and `DATA-MODEL.md` for scope and data definitions.
